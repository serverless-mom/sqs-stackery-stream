Goals for today:
* connect a Lambda to Simple Queueing Service
* Whether we can debug events going into SQS (find them on the AWS console)
* receive events via another Lambda


pieces needed:

Lambdas
Job Queues (SQS)
Stackery local edit - construct our CloudFormation template
AWS CLI to deploy that CF template
Stackery cloudlocal to update a lambda and use it to send a new message to SQS

Options to do all this:

aws console
Stackery Tools
Hand-edit CloudFormation template
use some other tool to make a CloudFormation


Notes:
In general you really want to use SQS as a job queue and not as anything else
* when you have a lambda, the two easy to poke it and make it go are to either run it locally or go into the AWS console and send a test event
